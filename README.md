# Raspberry pi CPU temperature exporter for Prometheus

this is a simple prometheus exporter that monitors the CPU temperature on a Raspberry Pi.

I am running mine on a RPI4 with Manjaro. As long as [raspberrypi/userland](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland) is installed, it should work on any OS.
